We have two populations. How to know if they are different? We sample a finite number of examples from
each. The null hypothesis says they are the same. We always assume the null hypothesis. To make it
simple we can assume one or more of the following:
- They are both normal distributions.
- They have same variance.


What is the distribution of p-value? - Uniform.
