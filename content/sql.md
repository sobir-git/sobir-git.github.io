# The idea of SQL

Entities exist. Multiple entities of the same _kind_ exist. Example, many humans.

All entities of the same kind have a set of attributes. Different entities differ 
because of attributes. Align those attributes in a _row_. All entities 
are now represented by a row. then, A collection of entities is a _table_.
